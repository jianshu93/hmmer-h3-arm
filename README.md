## HMMER - biological sequence analysis using profile HMMs

This is a copy of the arm branch of hmmer software. Since it's not released yet, I will just put everything needed here for users that want to use it natively on ARM64 machines.

The orginal repo is here: https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer

```
git clone https://github.com/jianshu93/hmmer-h3-arm
cd hmmer-h3-arm
make -j 8
```
